There was Gertrude.
And there was his sister Marian.
She had worked in the cannery the preceding summer, and her slim, pretty hands were all scarred with the tomato-knives.
He remembered the hard palms of his mother as she lay in her coffin.
He sat back on the bed with a bitter laugh, and finished taking off his shoes.
And then, suddenly, before his eyes, on the foul plaster-wall appeared a vision.
He stood in front of a gloomy tenement house.
It was night-time, in the East End of London, and before him stood Margey, a little factory girl of fifteen.
He had seen her home after the beanfeast.
She lived in that gloomy tenement, a place not fit for swine.
His hand was going out to hers as he said good night.
Somehow he was afraid of her.
And then her hand closed on his and pressed feverishly.
He felt her callouses grind and grate on his, and a great wave of pity welled over him.
Her glad little cry rang in his ears, and he felt her clinging to him like a cat.
Poor little starveling!
He continued to stare at the vision of what had happened in the long ago.
His flesh was crawling as it had crawled that night when she clung to him, and his heart was warm with pity.
It was a gray scene, greasy gray, and the rain drizzled greasily on the pavement stones.
He took the Browning and the Swinburne from the chair and kissed them.
Just the same, she told me to call again, he thought.
Understand!
Norman and Arthur knew that speech.
He had heard them talking it.
And they were her brothers.
He left the alcove in despair.
From every side the books seemed to press upon him and crush him.
He had never dreamed that the fund of human knowledge bulked so big.
He was frightened.
How could his brain ever master it all?
And so he wandered on, alternating between depression and elation as he stared at the shelves packed with wisdom.
In a way, it spoke a kindred speech.
Both he and it were of the sea.
There it was; he would teach himself navigation.
He would quit drinking, work up, and become a captain.
Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment.
As a captain, he could marry her (if she would have him).
He cast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down on a vision of ten thousand books.
No; no more of the sea for him.
There was power in all that wealth of books, and if he would do great things, he must do them on the land.
Besides, captains were not allowed to take their wives to sea with them.
Noon came, and afternoon.
But when he found the right shelf, he sought vainly for the answer.
He abandoned his search.
The man nodded.
Are you a sailor?
"Yes, sir," he answered.
Now, how did he know that?
A terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted Martin Eden.
He could not steel himself to call upon her.
He was afraid that he might call too soon, and so be guilty of an awful breach of that awful thing called etiquette.
The many books he read but served to whet his unrest.
Every page of every book was a peep-hole into the realm of knowledge.
His hunger fed upon what he read, and increased.
Also, he did not know where to begin, and continually suffered from lack of preparation.
The commonest references, that he could see plainly every reader was expected to know, he did not know.
And the same was true of the poetry he read which maddened him with delight.
He read more of Swinburne than was contained in the volume Ruth had lent him; and "Dolores" he understood thoroughly.
But surely Ruth did not understand it, he concluded.
These thoughts he had tried to share, but never had he found a woman capable of understanding - nor a man.
He had tried, at times, but had only puzzled his listeners.
And as his thoughts had been beyond them, so, he argued now, he must be beyond them.
He felt power move in him, and clenched his fists.
Those bold black eyes had nothing to offer.
He knew the thoughts behind them - of ice-cream and of something else.
They offered books and painting, beauty and repose, and all the fine elegance of higher existence.
Behind those black eyes he knew every thought process.
It was like clockwork.
He could watch every wheel go around.
Their bid was low pleasure, narrow as the grave, that palled, and the grave was at the end of it.
He had caught glimpses of the soul in them, and glimpses of his own soul, too.
"Lizzie," she replied, softening toward him, her hand pressing his arm, while her body leaned against his.
He talked on a few minutes before saying good night.
I kept it for you.
A week of heavy reading had passed since the evening he first met Ruth Morse, and still he dared not call.
Time and again he nerved himself up to call, but under the doubts that assailed him his determination died away.
But his eyes were strong, and they were backed by a body superbly strong.
Furthermore, his mind was fallow.
It had never been jaded by study, and it bit hold of the knowledge in the books with sharp teeth that would not let go.
It seemed to him, by the end of the week, that he had lived centuries, so far behind were the old life and outlook.
But he was baffled by lack of preparation.
He attempted to read books that required years of preliminary specialization.
It was the same with the economists.
He was bewildered, and yet he wanted to know.
She had never had any experiences of the heart.
She did not know the actual fire of love.
She did not dream of the volcanic convulsions of love, its scorching heat and sterile wastes of parched ashes.
She knew neither her own potencies, nor the potencies of the world; and the deeps of life were to her seas of illusion.
It was only natural.
There was something cosmic in such things, and there was something cosmic in him.
He came to her breathing of large airs and great spaces.
The blaze of tropic suns was in his face, and in his swelling, resilient muscles was the primordial vigor of life.
He was untamed, wild, and in secret ways her vanity was touched by the fact that he came so mildly to her hand.
Likewise she was stirred by the common impulse to tame the wild thing.
His swift development was a source of surprise and interest.
She detected unguessed finenesses in him that seemed to bud, day by day, like flowers in congenial soil.
She read Browning aloud to him, and was often puzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to mooted passages.
Then she played to him - no longer at him - and probed him with music that sank to depths beyond her plumb-line.
In an immediate way it personified his life.
But her singing he did not question.
It was too wholly her, and he sat always amazed at the divine melody of her pure soprano voice.
She enjoyed singing and playing to him.
Besides, it was pleasant to be with him.
He did not repel her.
That first repulsion had been really a fear of her undiscovered self, and the fear had gone to sleep.
Though she did not know it, she had a feeling in him of proprietary right.
Also, he had a tonic effect upon her.
Strength was what she needed, and he gave it to her in generous measure.
To come into the same room with him, or to meet him at the door, was to take heart of life.
And when he had gone, she would return to her books with a keener zest and fresh store of energy.
She knew her Browning, but it had never sunk into her that it was an awkward thing to play with souls.
As her interest in Martin increased, the remodelling of his life became a passion with her.
Butler, Charles Butler he was called, found himself alone in the world.
His father had come from Australia, you know, and so he had no relatives in California.
She paused for breath, and to note how Martin was receiving it.
Butler; but there was a frown upon his face as well.
How could he live on it?
He must have lived like a dog.
His early denials are paid for a thousand fold.
Martin looked at her sharply.
Her eyes dropped before his searching gaze.
By nature he is sober and serious.
He always was that.
"You can bet he was," Martin proclaimed.
Her own limits were the limits of her horizon; but limited minds can recognize limitations only in others.
"But I have not finished my story," she said.
Butler was always eager to work.
He never was late, and he was usually at the office a few minutes before his regular time.
And yet he saved his time.
Every spare moment was devoted to study.
He quickly became a clerk, and he made himself invaluable.
Father appreciated him and saw that he was bound to rise.
He became a lawyer, and hardly was he back in the office when father took him in as junior partner.
He is a great man.
Such a life is an inspiration to all of us.
It shows us that a man with will may rise superior to his environment.
"He is a great man," Martin said sincerely.
And then, in splendor and glory, came the great idea.
He would write.
He would write - everything - poetry and prose, fiction and description, and plays like Shakespeare.
There was career and the way to win to Ruth.
Butlers who earned thirty thousand a year and could be Supreme Court justices if they wanted to.
Once the idea had germinated, it mastered him, and the return voyage to San Francisco was like a dream.
He was drunken with unguessed power and felt that he could do anything.
In the midst of the great and lonely sea he gained perspective.
Clearly, and for the first lime, he saw Ruth and her world.
The thought was fire in him.
He would begin as soon as he got back.
The first thing he would do would be to describe the voyage of the treasure-hunters.
He would sell it to some San Francisco newspaper.
He would not tell Ruth anything about it, and she would be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print.
While he wrote, he could go on studying.
There were twenty-four hours in each day.
He was invincible.
He knew how to work, and the citadels would go down before him.
She did not think much of his plan.
Not that I know anything about it, of course.
I only bring common judgment to bear.
This education is indispensable for whatever career you select, and it must not be slipshod or sketchy.
You should go to high school.
"I would have to," he said grimly.
I must live and buy books and clothes, you know.
This change in him was her handiwork, and she was proud of it and fired with ambition further to help him.
But the most radical change of all, and the one that pleased her most, was the change in his speech.
Not only did he speak more correctly, but he spoke more easily, and there were many new words in his vocabulary.
Also, there was an awkward hesitancy, at times, as he essayed the new words he had learned.
He was just beginning to orientate himself and to feel that he was not wholly an intruder.
He told her of what he had been doing, and of his plan to write for a livelihood and of going on with his studies.
But he was disappointed at her lack of approval.
Up to then he had accepted existence, as he had lived it with all about him, as a good thing.
Who could tell?
He did not know enough to ask the man at the desk, and began his adventures in the philosophy alcove.
He had heard of book philosophy, but had not imagined there had been so much written about it.
The high, bulging shelves of heavy tomes humbled him and at the same time stimulated him.
Here was work for the vigor of his brain.
He could read English, but he saw there an alien speech.
How could she, living the refined life she did?
Higginbotham, who would have preferred the money taking the form of board.
On another night, his vigil was rewarded by a glimpse of Ruth through a second-story window.
He saw only her head and shoulders, and her arms raised as she fixed her hair before a mirror.
Then she pulled down the shade.
She was of the class that dealt with banks.
In one way, he had undergone a moral revolution.
He had always been easy-going.
It was not in his nature to give rebuff.
In the old days he would have smiled back, and gone further and encouraged smiling.
But now it was different.
He did smile back, then looked away, and looked no more deliberately.
But several times, forgetting the existence of the two girls, his eyes caught their smiles.
It was nothing new to him.
But it was different now.
He had it in his heart to wish that they could possess, in some small measure, her goodness and glory.
And not for the world could he hurt them because of their outreaching.
He was not flattered by it; he even felt a slight shame at his lowliness that permitted it.
He left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act, intent on seeing Her as she passed out.
They were looking for him, he knew; and for the moment he could have cursed that in him which drew women.
Their casual edging across the sidewalk to the curb, as they drew near, apprised him of discovery.
They slowed down, and were in the thick of the crown as they came up with him.
One of them brushed against him and apparently for the first time noticed him.
She was a slender, dark girl, with black, defiant eyes.
But they smiled at him, and he smiled back.
Also, she was struck by his face.
It was almost violent, this health of his, and it seemed to rush out of him and at her in waves of force.
And he, in turn, knew again the swimming sensation of bliss when he felt the contact of her hand in greeting.
The difference between them lay in that she was cool and self-possessed while his face flushed to the roots of the hair.
He stumbled with his old awkwardness after her, and his shoulders swung and lurched perilously.
Once they were seated in the living-room, he began to get on easily - more easily by far than he had expected.
She made it easy for him; and the gracious spirit with which she did it made him love her more madly than ever.
She had thought of this often since their first meeting.
She wanted to help him.
The old fascination of his neck was there, and there was sweetness in the thought of laying her hands upon it.
It seemed still a wanton impulse, but she had grown more used to it.
She did not dream that in such guise new-born love would epitomize itself.
Nor did she dream that the feeling he excited in her was love.
She did not know she desired him; but with him it was different.
As he gazed at her and listened, his thoughts grew daring.
He reviewed all the wild delight of the pressure of her hand in his at the door, and longed for it again.
His gaze wandered often toward her lips, and he yearned for them hungrily.
But there was nothing gross or earthly about this yearning.
Their substance was not mere human clay.
I was never inside a house like this.
I wanted it.
I want it now.
Here it is.
I want to make my way to the kind of life you have in this house.
Mebbe I ought to ask him.
Ruth did not speak immediately.
She had never looked in eyes that expressed greater power.
And for that matter so complex and quick was her own mind that she did not have a just appreciation of simplicity.
And yet she had caught an impression of power in the very groping of this mind.
It had seemed to her like a giant writhing and straining at the bonds that held him down.
Her face was all sympathy when she did speak.
You should go back and finish grammar school, and then go through to high school and university.
"But that takes money," he interrupted.
But then you have relatives, somebody who could assist you?
He shook his head.
The oldest died in India.
What it means is that a trust is like an egg, and it is not like an egg.
If you want to break an egg you have to do it from the outside.
The only way to break up a trust is from the inside.
Keep sitting on it until it hatches.
Somewhat to my surprise he acknowledged the corner.
"Once," said he.
But we lost out.
"Some unforeseen opposition came up, I suppose," I said.
We were self-curbed.
It was a case of auto-suppression.
There was a rift within the loot, as Albert Tennyson says.
That man was the most talented conniver at stratagems I ever saw.
Andy was educated, too, besides having a lot of useful information.
Oh, yes, the mine was all right.
The other half interest must have been worth two or three thousand.
I often wondered who owned that mine.
The town had about 2,000 inhabitants, mostly men.
I figured out that their principal means of existence was in living close to tall chaparral.
Me and Andy put up at a hotel that was built like something between a roof-garden and a sectional bookcase.
It began to rain the day we got there.
As the saying is, Juniper Aquarius was sure turning on the water plugs on Mount Amphibious.
But we could see the townspeople making a triangular procession from one to another all day and half the night.
Everybody seemed to know what to do with as much money as they had.
Bird City was built between the Rio Grande and a deep wide arroyo that used to be the old bed of the river.
Andy looks at it a long time.
And then he unfolds to me a instantaneous idea that has occurred to him.
Right there was organized a trust; and we walked back into town and put it on the market.
The river had busted through its old channel, and the town was surrounded by roaring torrents.
But the worst was yet to come.
So, naturally the body politic emits thirsty ejaculations of surprise and ports hellum for the Blue Snake.
And what does it find there?
The town marshal is there with two deputies to keep order, having been promised free drinks by the trust.
The nearest railroad was thirty miles away; and it would be two weeks at least before the river would be fordable.
So they began to cuss, amiable, and throw down dollars on the bar till it sounded like a selection on the xylophone.
It was beautiful and simple as all truly great swindles are.
We told the bartenders to take advantage of the lull, and do the same.
Then me and Andy counted the receipts.
He got off the safe and lit the biggest cigar in the house.
We have sure handed the small consumer a giant blow in the sole apoplectic region.
This little turn in bug juice is, verily, all to the Skibo.
It was the first drink I had ever known him to take.
I watched him to see what turn the whiskey was going to take in him.
There are two times when you never can tell what is going to happen.
One is when a man takes his first drink; and the other is when a woman takes her latest.
He was outwardly decent and managed to preserve his aquarium, but inside he was impromptu and full of unexpectedness.
I feel like if I once turned loose people would begin to call Senator Beveridge the Grand Young Sphinx of the Wabash.
Me and the boys will take care of the business.
Everybody will be through dinner pretty soon, and salt pork and beans makes a man pretty thirsty.
The streets were deserted except for some ducks and ladies going to the stores.
There was only a light drizzle falling then.
We put him in bed while he still muttered and gesticulated with his hands and feet.
I met a man who told me all about it.
Andy had made the finest two hour speech that had ever been heard in Texas, he said, or anywhere else in the world.
And say, Jeff, make that succotash fancier give you nice, clean, new bills.
I drove out to the Plunkett farm and hitched.
There was a man sitting on the front steps of the house.
He had on a white flannel suit, a diamond ring, golf cap and a pink ascot tie.
I see the left pocket of your coat sags a good deal.
Out with the goldbrick first.
I put it back in my pocket.
Yes; this is Plunkett, of Woodbine Centre.
Reserve four orchestra seats for Friday evening - my usual ones.
Have you got him there?
Let me see him.
Get away from the transmitter.
Now make him trot in a circle.
Yes, I can hear him.
Keep on - faster yet.
Now lead him up to the phone.
Get his nose nearer.
Then he passes the Henry Clays and sets out a bottle of green chartreuse, and goes over and looks at the ticker tape.
The horse turned round and took me back to the hotel.
I hitched him and went in to see Andy.
It looks incredulous to me that he could have inoculated himself against all the preordained systems of bucolic bunco.
Farmers was made for a purpose; and that was to furnish a livelihood to men like me and you.
Else why was we given brains?
His vest is red with blue dots, and he wears a high silk hat.
Wait here till I come back.
My life is never safe.
There was no pause of the realities wherein he moved.
He saw her hand coming out to his, and she looked him straight in the eyes as she shook hands, frankly, like a man.
The women he had known did not shake hands that way.
For that matter, most of them did not shake hands at all.
But he shook them aside and looked at her.
Never had he seen such a woman.
The women he had known!
Immediately, beside her, on either hand, ranged the women he had known.
There were women of the cattle camps, and swarthy cigarette-smoking women of Old Mexico.
She repressed a smile at sight of the red line that marked the chafe of the collar against the bronzed neck.
He was evidently unused to stiff collars.
This was a new experience for him.
All his life, up to then, he had been unaware of being either graceful or awkward.
Such thoughts of self had never entered his mind.
He sat down gingerly on the edge of the chair, greatly worried by his hands.
They were in the way wherever he put them.
Arthur was leaving the room, and Martin Eden followed his exit with longing eyes.
He felt lost, alone there in the room with that pale spirit of a woman.
I am sure it must have been some adventure.
"A Mexican with a knife, miss," he answered, moistening his parched lips and clearing hip throat.
After I got the knife away, he tried to bite off my nose.
But of all this no hint had crept into his speech.
"He tried to bite off my nose," he concluded.
"Oh," the girl said, in a faint, far voice, and he noticed the shock in her sensitive face.
Such sordid things as stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects for conversation with a lady.
People in the books, in her walk of life, did not talk about such things - perhaps they did not know about them, either.
There was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get started.
Then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek.
"It was just an accident," he said, putting his hand to his cheek.
"This man Swineburne," he began, attempting to put his plan into execution and pronouncing the I long.
"Swineburne," he repeated, with the same mispronunciation.
"Swinburne," she corrected.
"I never clapped eyes on him," was the reply.
How do you like his poetry?
And thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject he had suggested.
Here was intellectual life, he thought, and here was beauty, warm and wonderful as he had never dreamed it could be.
He forgot himself and stared at her with hungry eyes.
Here was something to live for, to win to, to fight for - ay, and die for.
The books were true.
There were such women in the world.
She was one of them.
But she, who knew little of the world of men, being a woman, was keenly aware of his burning eyes.
She had never had men look at her in such fashion, and it embarrassed her.
She stumbled and halted in her utterance.
The thread of argument slipped from her.
He frightened her, and at the same time it was strangely pleasant to be so looked upon.
She was clean, and her cleanness revolted; but she was woman, and she was just beginning to learn the paradox of woman.
"Yes, thank you," she said.
There are many of his poems that should never be read.
Not a line of the great poets can be spared without impoverishing the world by that much.
I had no idea he was such a - a scoundrel.
I guess that crops out in his other books.
He broke off lamely.
He was confused, painfully conscious of his inarticulateness.
He had felt the bigness and glow of life in what he had read, but his speech was inadequate.
Well, he decided, it was up to him to get acquainted in this new world.
It sounded like a threat.
His voice was determined, his eyes were flashing, the lines of his face had grown harsh.
And to her it seemed that the angle of his jaw had changed; its pitch had become unpleasantly aggressive.
At the same time a wave of intense virility seemed to surge out from him and impinge upon her.
"I think you could make it in - in your class," she finished with a laugh.
And though he sat there, blushing and humble, again she felt drawn to him.
She was surprised by a wanton thought that rushed into her mind.
She was shocked by this thought.
It seemed to reveal to her an undreamed depravity in her nature.
Besides, strength to her was a gross and brutish thing.
Her ideal of masculine beauty had always been slender gracefulness.
Yet the thought still persisted.
It bewildered her that she should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck.
In truth, she was far from robust, and the need of her body and mind was for strength.
But she did not know it.
Never trained that way, you see.
Mebbe you can put me right.
"By going to school, I fancy, and by studying," she answered.
"I went to school when I was a kid," he began to object.
He felt that she had become remoter from him by at least a million miles.
He did not know what "English" meant, but he made a mental note of that item of ignorance and passed on.
You have never attended high school?
"I had two years to run, when I left," he answered.
At the same moment he became aware that a woman was entering the room.
He saw the girl leave her chair and trip swiftly across the floor to the newcomer.
That must be her mother, he thought.
She was a tall, blond woman, slender, and stately, and beautiful.
Her gown was what he might expect in such a house.
His eyes delighted in the graceful lines of it.
She and her dress together reminded him of women on the stage.
Next his mind leaped to the Grand Hotel at Yokohama, where, too, from the sidewalk, he had seen grand ladies.
Then the city and the harbor of Yokohama, in a thousand pictures, began flashing before his eyes.
But he swiftly dismissed the kaleidoscope of memory, oppressed by the urgent need of the present.
The process of getting into the dining room was a nightmare to him.
Between halts and stumbles, jerks and lurches, locomotion had at times seemed impossible.
But at last he had made it, and was seated alongside of Her.
The array of knives and forks frightened him.
He watched them eating, and decided that they ate like pigs.
Well, he would be careful here.
He would make no noise.
He would keep his mind upon it all the time.
He glanced around the table.
They were her brothers, he reminded himself, and his heart warmed toward them.
How they loved each other, the members of this family!
Not in his world were such displays of affection between parents and children made.
It was a revelation of the heights of existence that were attained in the world above.
It was the finest thing yet that he had seen in this small glimpse of that world.
He was moved deeply by appreciation of it, and his heart was melting with sympathetic tenderness.
He had starved for love all his life.
His nature craved love.
It was an organic demand of his being.
Yet he had gone without, and hardened himself in the process.
He had not known that he needed love.
Nor did he know it now.
He merely saw it in operation, and thrilled to it, and thought it fine, and high, and splendid.
Morse was not there.
It was difficult enough getting acquainted with her, and her mother, and her brother, Norman.
Arthur he already knew somewhat.
The father would have been too much for him, he felt sure.
It seemed to him that he had never worked so hard in his life.
He was oppressed throughout the meal by the thought of finger-bowls.
Irrelevantly, insistently, scores of times, he wondered when they would come on and what they looked like.
What should his attitude be?
He wrestled continually and anxiously with the problem.
It was during the first part of the dinner, struggling to decide upon his attitude, that he was very quiet.
So he sat at table, perturbed by his own unfitness and at the same time charmed by all that went on about him.
For the first time he realized that eating was something more than a utilitarian function.
He was unaware of what he ate.
It was merely food.
He was feasting his love of beauty at this table where eating was an aesthetic function.
It was an intellectual function, too.
His mind was stirred.
The romance, and beauty, and high vigor of the books were coming true.
He curbed the impulse, arising out of his sea-training, to say "Yes, sir," and "No, sir," to her brothers.
Also, it was a dictate of his pride.
He was a civilized man, that was what he was, shoulder to shoulder, at dinner, with people he had read about in books.
He was in the books himself, adventuring through the printed pages of bound volumes.
He was no gentle lamb, and the part of second fiddle would never do for the high-pitched dominance of his nature.
Besides, he was confident that he could not keep it up.
He was by nature powerful of thought and sensibility, and the creative spirit was restive and urgent.
But he recovered himself quickly.
His cheeks were hot.
He took it as an exposure of another of his deficiencies.
"Yes," he said depreciatingly.
I can hit like a mule with my arms and shoulders.
He was not happy at what he had said.
He was filled with disgust at himself.
He had loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked about things that were not nice.
He certainly had not succeeded so far.
The masquerade would fail, and besides, masquerade was foreign to his nature.
There was no room in him for sham or artifice.
Whatever happened, he must be real.
Upon that he was resolved.
"Mathematics, arithmetic," was the answer.
Martin Eden nodded.
He had caught a glimpse of the apparently illimitable vistas of knowledge.
What he saw took on tangibility.
His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form.
It was like wine to him.
Martin Eden remembered his decision.
He had been a member of the crew of the smuggling schooner Halcyon when she was captured by a revenue cutter.
He saw with wide eyes, and he could tell what he saw.
He brought the pulsing sea before them, and the men and the ships upon the sea.
He communicated his power of vision, till they saw with his eyes what he had seen.
And while he talked, the girl looked at him with startled eyes.
His fire warmed her.
She wondered if she had been cold all her days.
She felt that she must lean toward him, and resisted by an effort.
Then, too, there was the counter impulse to shrink away from him.
And ever and again would come the draw of him, till she thought he must be evil to have such power over her.
All that was most firmly established in her mind was rocking.
His romance and adventure were battering at the conventions.
This man from outer darkness was evil.
Her mother saw it, and her mother was right.
The fire of him was no longer warm, and the fear of him was no longer poignant.
He gazed upon her in awe.
In his mind, as in her own, the gulf widened; but faster than it widened, towered his ambition to win across it.
He was remarkably susceptible to music.
It banished sordid fact, flooded his mind with beauty, loosed romance and to its heels added wings.
He did not understand the music she played.
It was different from the dancehall piano-banging and blatant brass bands he had heard.
Once, it entered his mind that there was a deliberate rebuff in all this.
He caught her spirit of antagonism and strove to divine the message that her hands pronounced upon the keys.
Then he dismissed the thought as unworthy and impossible, and yielded himself more freely to the music.
The old delightful condition began to be induced.
The known and the unknown were commingled in the dream-pageant that thronged his vision.
He entered strange ports of sun-washed lands, and trod market-places among barbaric peoples that no man had ever seen.
Swift as thought the pictures came and went.
He lay on a coral beach where the cocoanuts grew down to the mellowsounding surf.
It was a sensuous, tropic night.
In the background a volcano crater was silhouetted against the stars.
Overhead drifted a pale crescent moon, and the Southern Cross burned low in the sky.
He did not merely feel.
And she, glancing at him across her shoulder, saw something of all this in his face.
She was startled.
His mood was essentially religious.
He was humble and meek, filled with selfdisparagement and abasement.
In such frame of mind sinners come to the penitent form.
He was convicted of sin.
But this possession of her was dim and nebulous and totally different from possession as he had known it.
My house is closed.
Cease knocking at my door, and be off.
Inside was heard the clink of chain and bar, and the door was flung open.
David followed the Marquis out of the carriage.
"Assist the lady," he was ordered.
The poet obeyed.
He felt her small hand tremble as he guided her descent.
"Into the house," was the next command.
The room was the long dining-hall of the tavern.
A great oak table ran down its length.
The huge gentleman seated himself in a chair at the nearer end.
The lady sank into another against the wall, with an air of great weariness.
David stood, considering how best he might now take his leave and continue upon his way.
A dozen more lighted candles shone in the hall.
The great bulk of the marquis overflowed his chair.
He was dressed in fine black from head to foot save for the snowy ruffles at his wrist and throat.
Even the hilt and scabbard of his sword were black.
His expression was one of sneering pride.
The ends of an upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes.
The lady sat motionless, and now David perceived that she was young, and possessed of pathetic and appealing beauty.
He was startled from the contemplation of her forlorn loveliness by the booming voice of the marquis.
I am a poet.
The moustache of the marquis curled nearer to his eyes.
She is of noble descent and is possessed of ten thousand francs a year in her own right.
As to her charms, you have but to observe for yourself.
Do not interrupt me.
You, shepherd, are the first.
Mademoiselle must be wed this night.
If not you, then another.
You have ten minutes in which to make your decision.
Do not vex me with words or questions.
Ten minutes, shepherd; and they are speeding.
The marquis drummed loudly with his white fingers upon the table.
He sank into a veiled attitude of waiting.
It was as if some great house had shut its doors and windows against approach.
"Mademoiselle," he said, and he marvelled to find his words flowing easily before so much elegance and beauty.
I have also had the fancy, at times, that I am a poet.
If it be the test of a poet to adore and cherish the beautiful, that fancy is now strengthened.
Can I serve you in any way, mademoiselle?
The young woman looked up at him with eyes dry and mournful.
He is my uncle, the brother of my father, and my only relative.
He loved my mother, and he hates me because I am like her.
He has made my life one long terror.
I am afraid of his very looks, and never before dared to disobey him.
But to-night he would have married me to a man three times my age.
You will forgive me for bringing this vexation upon you, monsieur.
You will, of course, decline this mad act he tries to force upon you.
But let me thank you for your generous words, at least.
I have had none spoken to me in so long.
Poet he must have been, for Yvonne was forgotten; this fine, new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace.
The subtle perfume from her filled him with strange emotions.
His tender look fell warmly upon her.
She leaned to it, thirstily.
But here David found housing commensurate to his scant purse.
Daylight and candlelight found him at pen and paper.
One afternoon he was returning from a foraging trip to the lower world, with bread and curds and a bottle of thin wine.
A loose, dark cloak, flung open, showed a rich gown beneath.
Her eyes changed swiftly with every little shade of thought.
One hand raised her gown, undraping a little shoe, high-heeled, with its ribbons dangling, untied.
So heavenly she was, so unfitted to stoop, so qualified to charm and command!
Perhaps she had seen David coming, and had waited for his help there.
Ah, would monsieur pardon that she occupied the stairway, but the shoe!
He leaned against the balustrade, clutching his bottle of sour wine.
"You have been so good," she said, smiling.
I have met him twice or thrice upon the stairs.
I questioned him, fearing that he might dwell too near the room in which we are accustomed to meet.
He is mine, if I will.
He writes poems in his garret, and I think he dreams of me.
He will do what I say.
He shall take the message to the palace.
The marquis rose from his chair and bowed.
"You did not permit me to finish my sentence, countess," he said.
I believe you to be good and true, and I know of no other help.
How I flew through the streets among the swaggering men!
Monsieur, my mother is dying.
My uncle is a captain of guards in the palace of the king.
Some one must fly to bring him.
And then, sitting there, his eye fell upon a bright star, one that he and Yvonne had named for theirs.
That set him thinking of Yvonne, and he wondered if he had not been too hasty.
Why should he leave her and his home because a few hot words had come between them?
Was love so brittle a thing that jealousy, the very proof of it, could break it?
Mornings always brought a cure for the little heartaches of evening.
There was yet time for him to return home without any one in the sweetly sleeping village of Vernoy being the wiser.
David rose, and shook off his unrest and the wild mood that had tempted him.
He set his face steadfastly back along the road he had come.
By the time he had retravelled the road to Vernoy, his desire to rove was gone.
The corner of her eye was engaged in a search for David, albeit her set mouth seemed unrelenting.
He saw the look; braved the mouth, drew from it a recantation and, later, a kiss as they walked homeward together.
Three months afterwards they were married.
He gave them a wedding that was heard of three leagues away.
Both the young people were favourites in the village.
The sheep and the cottage descended to him.
He already had the seemliest wife in the village.
But you must keep your eyes upon her yard, for her flower beds were so neat and gay they restored to you your sight.
But a day came when David drew out paper from a long-shut drawer, and began to bite the end of a pencil.
Spring had come again and touched his heart.
Poet he must have been, for now Yvonne was well-nigh forgotten.
This fine new loveliness of earth held him with its witchery and grace.
The perfume from her woods and meadows stirred him strangely.
Daily had he gone forth with his flock, and brought it safe at night.
But now he stretched himself under the hedge and pieced words together on his bits of paper.
Her pans and kettles grew dull, but her eyes had caught their flash.
She pointed out to the poet that his neglect was reducing the flock and bringing woe upon the household.
David hired a boy to guard the sheep, locked himself in the little room at the top of the cottage, and wrote more poems.
The boy, being a poet by nature, but not furnished with an outlet in the way of writing, spent his time in slumber.
Sometimes she would stand in the yard and rail at David through his high window.
Papineau, the kind, wise, meddling old notary, saw this, as he saw everything at which his nose pointed.
It would distress me to be obliged to attest a paper signifying the bankruptcy of his son.
But that is what you are coming to.
I speak as an old friend.
He took David inside to his study and sat him down upon a little island beat upon by a sea of books.
Monsieur Bril had a conscience.
He flinched not even at a mass of manuscript the thickness of a finger-length and rolled to an incorrigible curve.
He broke the back of the roll against his knee and began to read.
He slighted nothing; he bored into the lump as a worm into a nut, seeking for a kernel.
Meanwhile, David sat, marooned, trembling in the spray of so much literature.
It roared in his ears.
He held no chart or compass for voyaging in that sea.
Half the world, he thought, must be writing books.
Then he took off his spectacles, and wiped them with his handkerchief.
"In the best of health," said David.
The flock has had ill fortune.
To that number it has decreased from eight hundred and fifty.
The sheep brought you plenty.
You went into the fields with them and lived in the keen air and ate the sweet bread of contentment.
Am I right thus far?
"It was so," said David.
"I see a crow," said David, looking.
You know that bird, Monsieur Mignot; he is the philosopher of the air.
He is happy through submission to his lot.
None so merry or full-crawed as he with his whimsical eye and rollicking step.
The fields yield him what he desires.
Is the nightingale any happier, do you think?
David rose to his feet.
The crow cawed harshly from his tree.
"I thank you, Monsieur Bril," he said, slowly.
"I could not have missed it," said Monsieur Bril, with a sigh.
Live your poetry, man; do not try to write it any more.
"I thank you," said David, again.
Back along the road to Vernoy he trudged with his poems under his arm.
I must purchase firearms to protect them.
What have you?
There are some choice firearms in the lot.
This pistol - oh, a weapon fit for a prince!
"I will charge it," said Zeigler.
David laid his pistol under his coat and walked to his cottage.
Yvonne was not there.
Of late she had taken to gadding much among the neighbours.
But a fire was glowing in the kitchen stove.
David opened the door of it and thrust his poems in upon the coals.
As they blazed up they made a singing, harsh sound in the flue.
He went up to his attic room and closed the door.
So quiet was the village that a score of people heard the roar of the great pistol.
They flocked thither, and up the stairs where the smoke, issuing, drew their notice.
The women chattered in a luxury of zealous pity.
Robert, taking his cigar from his mouth.
Robert began to mask, as was his habit, a tendency to softheartedness with a spurious anger.
I told you to go home, Bushrod.
Miss Lucy said that, did she?
Confound it!
Are you going to stand there all night gabbing like a coffee-coloured gander?
The train whistled again.
Now it was at the water tank, a mile away.
"Marse Robert," said Uncle Bushrod, laying his hand on the satchel that the banker held.
I knows where you got it in de bank.
Uncle Bushrod bowed his head to the expected storm, but he did not flinch.
If the house of Weymouth was to fall, he would fall with it.
The banker spoke, and Uncle Bushrod blinked with surprise.
The storm was there, but it was suppressed to the quietness of a summer breeze.
You have presumed upon the leniency with which you have been treated to meddle unpardonably.
So you know what is in this satchel!
Your long and faithful service is some excuse, but - go home, Bushrod - not another word!
But Bushrod grasped the satchel with a firmer hand.
The headlight of the train was now lightening the shadows about the station.
The roar was increasing, and folks were stirring about at the track side.
The train was standing at the station.
Some men were pushing trucks along the side.
Two or three sleepy passengers got off and wandered away into the night.
Robert released his hold on the satchel.
You can understand that, of course.
"Listen," said the millionaire, impressively.
"Then you force me to say good night," said the millionaire.
Twice that day had his money been scorned by simple ones to whom his dollars had appeared as but tin tobacco-tags.
Pilkins walked away rapidly, and then turned abruptly and returned to the bench where the young couple sat.
He took off his hat and began to speak.
His voice just suited me.
Man, three days of that light-housekeeping was plenty for me.
Aunt Maggie was affectionate as ever.
She was a hedger from Hedgersville, Hedger County.
Seventy-five cents a day was the limit she set.
We cooked our own meals in the room.
She offers to move into a swell room with a two-burner stove and running water.
I walked straight to the Acropolis and asked for my job back, and I got it.
How did you say your writings were getting along?
And, by the way, did you ever happen to know a newspaper artist - oh, shut up!
I know I asked you before.
I wonder what paper he works on?
Ida Bates saw who it was with her back-hair comb.
I saw her turn pink, perfect statue that she was - a miracle that I share with Pygmalion only.
After the ceremony I dragged Lathrop aside.
It was me that they hung out paper flowers and palm branches for.
I am not a jealous man; I am stating facts.
The people were Nebuchadnezzars; they bit the grass before me; there was no dust in the town for them to bite.
They bowed down to Judson Tate.
They knew that I was the power behind Sancho Benavides.
Looking handsome.
Oh, what a mistake!
But I was going to tell you.
The Little Big High Low Jack-in-the-game of the town came around and kowtowed.
They had heard about Judson Tate.
But there are compensations.
For instance, I am It in this country as far as the eye can reach, and then a few perches and poles.
Or large, either.
With your reputation and my looks combined in one man, how can she resist him?
And what do you think he wants me to do?
For him to ask me was a compliment - an acknowledgment of his own shortcomings.
Well, Fergus and the duenna, Francesca, attended to the details.
And one night they fetched me a long black cloak with a high collar, and led me to the house at midnight.
And, smothering a laugh as I thought of the tongue-tied Fergus, I began to talk.
Both of us knew English and Spanish; so in two languages I tried to win the heart of the lady for my friend Fergus.
But for the bars to the window I could have done it in one.
At the end of the hour she dismissed me and gave me a big, red rose.
I handed it over to Fergus when I got home.
At last she admitted that her heart was mine, and spoke of having seen me every afternoon when she drove in the plaza.
It was Fergus she had seen, of course.
But it was my talk that won her.
And she put her hand between the bars for me to kiss.
I bestowed the kiss and took the news to Fergus.
But I went; and children and dogs took to the banana groves and mangrove swamps as soon as they had a look at my face.
I saw at a glance that I must be hers and she mine forever.
I thought of my face and nearly fainted; and then I thought of my other talents and stood upright again.
And I had been wooing her for three weeks for another man!
But she never looked at me.
And that handsome man only ruffles his curls and smirks and prances like a lady-killer at my side.
I am no man to play tricks on a friend.
Struck too, are you?
Francesca tells me that Anabela talks of nothing but me, day and night.
Judson Tate.
But up prances the alcalde and almost wipes the dust off my shoes with his forehead.
No mere good looks could have won me that sensational entrance.
Fergus was at the other end of the room trying to break away from two maroons and a claybank girl.
When she took the first look at my face she dropped her fan and nearly turned her chair over from the shock.
When she heard me speak she jumped, and her eyes got as big as alligator pears.
She was coming my way.
She knew of Judson Tate, and what a big man he was, and the big things he had done; and that was in my favour.
I ranged from the second G below the staff up to F-sharp above it.
I set my voice to poetry, art, romance, flowers, and moonlight.
Oh, the vocal is the true art - no doubt about that.
Handsome is as handsome palavers.
In two weeks Anabela was engaged to me, and Fergus was out.
I was calling regular every evening then, and we were to be married in a month.
She looked at my rugged features without any expression of fear or repugnance.
I walked slowly up to the little park near my hotel, leaving Judson Tate alone with his conscience.
My feelings were lacerated.
He had poured gently upon me a story that I might have used.
And, at the last it had proven to be a commercial pill, deftly coated with the sugar of fiction.
The worst of it was that I could not offer it for sale.
Advertising departments and counting-rooms look down upon me.
And it would never do for the literary.
Therefore I sat upon a bench with other disappointed ones until my eyelids drooped.
I went to my room, and, as my custom is, read for an hour stories in my favourite magazines.
This was to get my mind back to art again.
And as I read each story, I threw the magazines sadly and hopelessly, one by one, upon the floor.
And when the last one was hurled from me I took heart.
Genius, whose coronations alone are democratic, had woven a chaplet of chaparral for the brow of Lonny Briscoe.
The outcome, seven feet by twelve of besmeared canvas, stood, gilt-framed, in the lobby of the Capitol.
The boarding-houses were corralling the easy dollars of the gamesome law-makers.
Order reigned within her borders.
Life and property were as safe there, sir, as anywhere among the corrupt cities of the effete East.
With impunity might the tenderfoot ventilate his "stovepipe" or his theories of culture.
The arts and sciences received nurture and subsidy.
Rarely has the San Saba country contributed to the spread of the fine arts.
Why he came to woo art is beyond postulation.
Beyond doubt, some spore of the afflatus must have sprung up within him in spite of the desert soil of San Saba.
The landscape presented fitting and faithful accessories.
Chaparral, mesquit, and pear were distributed in just proportions.
A richly mottled rattlesnake lay coiled beneath a pale green clump of prickly pear in the foreground.
Citizens and lawmakers passed there by twos and groups and sometimes crowds to gaze upon it.
Many - perhaps a majority of them - had lived the prairie life and recalled easily the familiar scene.
Hundreds of connoisseurs had straddled their broncos and ridden miles to view it before its removal to the capital.
Senator Mullens desired reelection, and he knew the importance of the San Saba vote.
He also knew that with the help of Senator Kinney - who was a power in the legislature - the thing could be put through.
Few artists have uncovered their first picture to the world under happier auspices than did Lonny Briscoe.
It looks like the worst kind of a chromo to me.
The man who carved the state out of the wilderness.
The man who settled the Indians.
The man who cleaned out the horse thieves.
The man who refused the crown.
Do you see the point now?
"Wrap up the picture," said Kinney.
By the hour and minute of it you must dwell under the sway and direct authority of Phoebe, the ninth satellite.
And for many years before.
I told him that for the time we would banish both astrology and astronomy from our heads.
The manifest valour and enthusiasm of the man drew me.
We sent for a tug to tow us back and lost three days.
When we struck the blue waters of the Gulf, all the storm clouds of the Atlantic seemed to have concentrated above us.
He weathered every storm on deck, smoking a black pipe, to keep which alight rain and sea-water seemed but as oil.
And he shook his fist at the black clouds behind which his baleful star winked its unseen eye.
When the skies cleared one evening, he reviled his malignant guardian with grim humour.
Twinkle, twinkle, little devil!
Get busy and sink the ship, you one-eyed banshee.
Sounds as mild as a milkmaid.
Five days only should have landed us in Esperando.
Also in the manual of arms - but, alas!
Even a Mexican might have crossed his path in safety while he was in this mood.
The Kid openly boarded the north-bound passenger train that departed five minutes later.
But at Webb, a few miles out, where it was flagged to take on a traveller, he abandoned that manner of escape.
There were telegraph stations ahead; and the Kid looked askance at electricity and steam.
Saddle and spur were his rocks of safety.
The man whom he had shot was a stranger to him.
Most of them waited, half asleep, with sagging limbs and drooping heads.
But one, a long-legged roan with a curved neck, snorted and pawed the turf.
For the Kid there was no turning back now.
With the springing roan under him he felt little care or uneasiness.
A sailor had been dispatched for the missing cargo.
Meanwhile the captain paced the sands, chewing profanely at his pocket store.
His complexion was naturally dark; and the sun and wind of an outdoor life had burned it to a coffee brown.
He looked beyond Captain Boone at the gulf with the impersonal and expressionless dignity of a Chinese emperor.
I never saw it before.
I was just looking at it.
Not thinking of selling it, are you?
"Not this trip," said the captain.
Boone, skipper.
Cargo - lumber, corrugated iron, and machetes.
The bananys and oranges and hurricanes and pineapples that ye eat comes from there.
Second cabin.
"All right, buddy," said the captain.
Thacker, the United States consul at Buenas Tierras, was not yet drunk.
They told me it was customary to light at your camp before starting in to round up the town.
I just came in on a ship from Texas.
The Kid laughed.
"Sprague Dalton," he said.
Try a cigar?
"They speak Spanish here," said the consul.
Everybody speaks it on the range where I come from.
He regarded the kid absorbedly.
"You look like a Spaniard, too," he continued.
And I come down to your parrot-and-monkey range just for to smell the morning-glories and marigolds.
Thacker got up and closed the door.
"Let me see your hand," he said.
"I can do it," he said excitedly.
It will heal in a week.
But no barehanded scrapping, like ladies at a tea-party, for me.
Old Santos Urique lives there.
He owns half the gold-mines in the country.
Twelve years ago they lost a kid.
Everybody knows about it.
Brace up, and make a man of yourself.
Stop cracking safes, and live straight.
"Oh, no," laughed the warden.
How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job?
Or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you?
Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him come to the bull-pen.
Better think over my advice, Valentine.
The warden gave him a cigar, and shook hands.
They came by the hotel where Jimmy still boarded, and he ran up to his room and brought along his suitcase.
Then they went on to the bank.
The clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good-looking, agreeable young man who was going to marry Miss Annabel.
Jimmy set his suit-case down.
Ralph, how heavy it is?
Feels like it was full of gold bricks.
The Elmore Bank had just put in a new safe and vault.
Adams was very proud of it, and insisted on an inspection by every one.
The vault was a small one, but it had a new, patented door.
It fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle, and had a time-lock.
Spencer, who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest.
The two children, May and Agatha, were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs.
Suddenly there was a scream or two from the women, and a commotion.
Robbins, an investigator by nature, sent a curious glance roving about the room.
Oh, madame!
Since when - oh!
At his words, Madame Tibault and Dumars approached.
Where I get them from?
Robbins explained.
Mister Morin was right.
He dragged Dumars by the arm into the outer room.
I advise you to join me.
Now, that green stuff you drink is no good.
It stimulates thought.
What we want to do is to forget to remember.
Her name is Belle of Kentucky, twelveyear-old Bourbon.
In quarts.
How does the idea strike you?
A man with a thick black-leather wallet under his arm left the train and walked rapidly up the main street of the town.
Indecision had no part in the movements of the man with the wallet.
He was well dressed in the prevailing Eastern style.
His air denoted a quiet but conscious reserve force, if not actual authority.
Upon one corner stood the post-office.
The cashier was examining the mail when he noticed the stranger standing at his window.
He had had to make that statement so often to early birds since San Rosario adopted city banking hours.
"I am well aware of that," said the other man, in cool, brittle tones.
Walk right around, please.
Edlinger, the cashier - a middle-aged gentleman of deliberation, discretion, and method.
Not overly much money on hand, but able to stand the storms, sir, stand the storms.
I will take the cash first, please.
He knew it was right to a cent, and he had nothing to fear, but he was nervous and flustered.
So was every man in the bank.
He looked to be a man who would never make nor overlook an error.
Nettlewick first seized the currency, and with a rapid, almost juggling motion, counted it by packages.
Then he spun the sponge cup toward him and verified the count by bills.
The air was full of fractional currency when he came to the halves and quarters.
He counted the last nickle and dime.
He had the scales brought, and he weighed every sack of silver in the vault.
This newly-imported examiner was so different from Sam Turner.
Halves and quarters and dimes?
Not for Sam Turner.
"No chicken feed for me," he would say when they were set before him.
List of over-drafts, please.
Unsigned bills of the bank, next.
Two men of very different types shook hands.
One was a finished product of the world of straight lines, conventional methods, and formal affairs.
The other was something freer, wider, and nearer to nature.
Tom Kingman had not been cut to any pattern.
He had been mule-driver, cowboy, ranger, soldier, sheriff, prospector, and cattleman.
We will take them up now, if you please.
He had gone through the First National at almost record-breaking speed - but thoroughly, as he did everything.
The running order of the bank was smooth and clean, and that had facilitated his work.
There was but one other bank in the town.
He received from the Government a fee of twenty-five dollars for each bank that he examined.
He should be able to go over those loans and discounts in half an hour.
Otherwise, he would have to spend the night and Sunday in this uninteresting Western town.
Nettlewick was rushing matters.
Nobody in the bank knows those notes as I do.
Next, he took up the larger loans, inquiring scrupulously into the condition of their endorsers or securities.
The clerical work seems to be done accurately and punctually.
Your past-due paper is moderate in amount, and promises only a small loss.
And now, there is one thing more, and I will have finished with the bank.
They are secured, according to their faces, by various stocks, bonds, shares, etc.
Those securities are missing from the notes to which they should be attached.
I suppose you have them in the safe or vault.
You will permit me to examine them.
I have taken them.
You may hold me personally responsible for their absence.
Nettlewick felt a slight thrill.
He had not expected this.
He had struck a momentous trail when the hunt was drawing to a close.
"The securities were taken by me," repeated the major.
There was a desk, and a table, and half-a-dozen leather-covered chairs.
On the wall was the mounted head of a Texas steer with horns five feet from tip to tip.
You are aware, also, of what my duty must compel me to do.
Do your duty.
But, I spoke of my friend.
I did want you to hear me tell you about Bob.
Nettlewick settled himself in his chair.
There would be no leaving San Rosario for him that day.
It was not the first crime the examiner had unearthed.
One cashier had shot himself at his desk before him.
The day is that hot, senor.
Maybeso it is of desirableness to leave him out to get the cool.
I know what you want.
You want to tell me that story again about Johnny Ammiger and the widow on the train.
Sitting on ice, and calling his best friends pseudonyms.
Now, what was it Johnny said to the widow first?
Yes, neither me nor Jones breathed with soul so dead.
He was some pumpkin both in politics and colour, and the friend of me and Jones.
While he was in the States he had acquired a synopsis of the English language and the art of admiring our institutions.
The hearts of Americans and Salvadorians should beat together.
Of your history and your great Washington I know.
It made us feel good.
He must have heard the news going round in Philadelphia about that disturbance we had with England.
We were talking about it when you came in.
He might suspend the rules for one day.
He will aid us.
He dug his trench on the plaza, and got half a beef on the coals for an all-night roast.
None of them have ever held Federal positions.
They have been land-holders, slave-owners, and planters on a large scale.
Have you decided to accept this appointment, William?
"I am thinking it over," said Billy, slowly, regarding the ash of his cigar.
"You have been a good son to me," continued the Governor, stirring his pipe with the handle of a penholder.
Especially in this, our native town, is your name linked with mine in the talk of our citizens.
"I never knew anyone to forget the vindculum," murmured Billy, unintelligibly.
I have not hesitated to exert it in your behalf whenever opportunity offered.
And you have deserved it, William.
And now this appointment comes to take you away from me.
I have but a few years left to live.
I am almost dependent upon others now, even in walking and dressing.
What would I do without you, my son?
A tear trickled from his eye.
Elmville is good enough for me.
The General whistled.
When does he leave?
We must have a reception.
Great Gatlings!
Think of it!
Our little, wood-sawing, mealy-mouthed Billy!
Elmville is disgraced forever until she lines up in a hurry for ratification and apology.
The venerable Moloch smiled fatuously.
He refuses to leave me in my old age.
He is a good son.
The commissioner betrayed a slight impatience.
Am I just a knot on a mesquite stump?
Charge it up to Insurance and the other two sideshows.
Come, now, Uncle Frank, let her have the money.
The clerks were beginning to listen.
Neither can you.
The treasurer called him back.
"Never mind, Uncle Frank," said the commissioner, in a softer tone.
Besides, her case is in my hands.
It seems to be about as important as an almanac or a hotel register.
You want to keep your eye on the Department of Insurance, Statistics, and History.
The commissioner returned to his office, looking thoughtful.
He opened and closed an inkstand on his desk many times with extreme and undue attention.
The department will see you through.
He is living there now.
He wanted to give a dinner at his old home to a few friends.
The prairies were somewhat dim, and the moonlight was pale orange, diluted with particles of an impalpable, flying mist.
Santa turned her face to the southeast and threw three kisses thitherward; for there was none to see.
Then she sped silently to the blacksmith-shop, fifty yards away; and what she did there can only be surmised.
But the forge glowed red; and there was a faint hammering such as Cupid might make when he sharpens his arrow-points.
To the corral where the Sussex cattle were penned she sped with these things swiftly in the moonlight.
She opened the gate and slipped inside the corral.
The Sussex cattle were mostly a dark red.
But among this bunch was one that was milky white - notable among the others.
And now Santa shook from her shoulder something that we had not seen before - a rope lasso.
She freed the loop of it, coiling the length in her left hand, and plunged into the thick of the cattle.
The white cow was her object.
She swung the lasso, which caught one horn and slipped off.
The next throw encircled the forefeet and the animal fell heavily.
Santa made for it like a panther; but it scrambled up and dashed against her, knocking her over like a blade of grass.
Again she made her cast, while the aroused cattle milled around the four sides of the corral in a plunging mass.
And then she ran swiftly to her furnace at the gate and brought the branding-iron, queerly shaped and white-hot.
The beasts arrived at Rancho Seco one evening at dusk; and were received and counted by the foreman of the ranch.
He dismounted stiffly, and strode, with whizzing spurs, to the house.
His horse gave a great sigh and swayed foam-streaked, with down-drooping head and closed eyes.
But waste not your pity upon Belshazzar, the flea-bitten sorrel.
The horseman stumbled into the house.
"I was a skunk," said Webb Yeager.
"I saw it," said Webb.
What they meant God knows; and you shall know, if you rightly read the primer of events.
I was a mangy, sheep-stealing coyote.
Do you know who I am?
I am Santa Yeager, First Lady of the Bedchamber.
Come here.
She dragged him from the gallery into the room to the right.
Down on your knees and look at his Highness.
Them beeves is just turned out on the trail.
"You hear your boss, Bud," said Webb Yeager, with a broad grin - just as he had said a year ago.
"I thought so," said Quinn.
What brand is that?
I turned to "What to do in Case of Accidents," on page 117.
I run my finger down the page, and struck it.
Good old Herkimer, he never overlooked anything!
It said: Suffocation from Inhaling Smoke or Gas.
There is nothing better than flaxseed.
Place a few seed in the outer corner of the eye.
I shoved the Handbook back in my pocket, and grabbed a boy that was running by.
Four of the firemen and citizens grabs hold of me.
And then I busted into the house.
I was a heap more cooked than the hurry-up orders of broiled chicken that you get in restaurants.
I carried her out fifty yards from the house and laid her on the grass.
They fetched my coat, and I gets out the Handbook.
Flaxseed in the outer corner of the eye, it says.
That flaxseed done me more good than anything I ever tried.
Sampson, embellishing and adorning it.
Some of the boys been telling you about me and that pancake racket?
Was there a story about pancakes?
They never irritated me like they do most cowmen.
I never thought it was worth while to be hostile with a snoozer.
The sheep person helped her off; and they stood throwing each other sentences all sprightful and sagacious for a while.
His seeing arrangement was grey enough, but his eye-lashes was pink and his hair was sandy, and that gave you the idea.
Sheep man?
I popped over one after the other with my forty-five, just to show him.
That is a bad habit you have got of riding with young ladies over at Pimienta.
What would I do with a wife?
If you ever saw that ranch of mine!
I do my own cooking and mending.
She sang some, and exasperated the piano quite a lot with quotations from the operas.
Thinks I, if Jackson Bird can now be persuaded to migrate, I win.
Pancakes is just whirling in my head like wagon wheels.
Start her off, now - pound of flour, eight dozen eggs, and so on.
He turns around to get a glass on the table, and I see a forty-five in his hip pocket.
We got there in time for dinner; and I put our thumb-prints on the register of the most expensive hotel in the city.
Object is no expense.
It was all served at once.
The dinner comes in threes of a kind.
Louis topics, the water supply and the colour line.
Solly gets up and comes around to me.
I thought you said they had some beans here.
He saw a saddleshop open, and some of the sadness faded from his eyes.
Eleven hundred dollars the two cost him.
In a little side street, where there was no street and no sidewalks and no houses, he finds what he is looking for.
We go into a shanty and sit on high stools among stevedores and boatmen, and eat beans with tin spoons.
Yes, sir, beans - beans boiled with salt pork.
And the building-and-loan associations and the fair have about killed it.
Guess we might as well go to bed.
Wait till you see Chicago, though.
But not for the grass-fed man of the pampas!
Solly grew sadder day by day.
And I got fearful about my salary, and knew I must play my trump card.
I knew his habits by then; so in a couple of hours I found him in a saddle-shop.
He invested about nine hundred dollars in there.
I wanted to know where to look for Solly when he got lost.
I showed him the horse-cars on Broadway and the Staten Island ferry-boats.
And then I piled up the sensations on him, but always keeping a lot of warmer ones up my sleeve.
They were out in numerous quantities, with the fat of the land showing in their clothes.
It was his first in two weeks, and it gave me hope.
She was a chorus-girl in a Broadway musical comedy.
I followed him.
I wondered whether anybody was.
But pretty soon afterward Solly failed to show up at dinner-time for several days.
I cornered him.
He confessed that he had found a restaurant on Third Avenue where they cooked beans in Texas style.
I made him take me there.
The minute I set foot inside the door I threw up my hands.
And then we sat down and had beans.
I saw her working it.
She was healthy-looking and plain dressed.
When she wants a man, she manages it so that every time he looks at her he finds her looking at him.
I went out and found a cab.
I felt sure there was something wrong.
Neither was the smooth-haired lady.
I asked Solly to step around the corner for a few words.
He was grinning clear across his face; but I had not administered the grin.
And they are fit for kings to ride on.
The six he sent me must have cost him three thousand dollars.
Who would buy one except one of these rajahs and princes of Asia and Africa?
I know every tan royal dub and smoked princerino from Mindanao to the Caspian Sea.
Now look here.
From an inside pocket he drew a tightly folded newspaper with muchworn edges, and indicated a paragraph.
"Read that," said the saddler to royalty.
His stables contain more than a thousand horses of the purest Persian breeds.
It is said that this powerful prince contemplates a visit to the United States at an early date.
Polk triumphantly.
Have you three dollars that you could loan me for a short time?
It happened that I had; and I did.
The floor was bare and clean.
White curtains waved in the gulf breeze through the open windows.
Some well-mounted heads of deer and one of an enormous black javeli projected from the walls.
A wide, cool cot-bed stood in a corner.
Nueces County people regarded this guest chamber as fit for a prince.
McGuire showed his eyeteeth at it.
He took out his nickel and spun it up to the ceiling.
Well, you can frisk me if you wanter.
Once was quite a plenty.
I never held you up for a cent.
I never gave you a hard-luck story till you asked me.
Here I am fifty miles from a bellboy or a cocktail.
Raidler went to the door and called.
A slender, bright-complexioned Mexican youth about twenty came quickly.
Raidler spoke to him in Spanish.
He is very sick.
What doesn't belong in this list: Meat, Eggs, Wife, Blowjob?
Blowjob: You can beat your meat, eggs or wife, but you can't beat a blowjob.

A: 68 because at 69 you have to turn around.
What do a Rubix cube and a penis have in common?
The longer you play with them, the harder they get.

What do you get when you cross Raggedy Ann and the Pillsbury Dough Boy?
A red headed bitch with a yeast infection.

A: Melt them down, make a tire, and call it Goodyear.
What does bungee jumping and hookers have in common?
They both cost a hundred bucks and if the rubber breaks, you're screwed.
Curl Up and Die.
I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three kids in tow and asked loudly, How much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow job?
Pad, please!
An insurance man visited me at home to talk about our mortgage insurance.
He was throwing a lot of facts and figures at me, and I wanted to follow as best I could, so I told my 6-year-old son to run and get me a pad.
He came back and handed me a Kotex right in front of our guest.
Ho, Ho, Ho.
I was taking a shower when my two year old son came into the bathroom and wrapped himself in toilet paper.
Although he made a mess, he looked adorable, so I ran for my camera and took a few shots.
They came out so well that I had copies made and included one with each of our Christmas cards.
Days later, a relative called about the picture, laughing hysterically, and suggesting I take a closer look.
Puzzled, I stared at the photo and was shocked to discover that in addition to my son, I had captured my reflection in the mirror - wearing nothing but a camera!
Lady Golfer.
I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of golf balls.
I was unhappy with the women's type I had been using.
After browsing for several minutes, I was approached by one of the good-looking gentlemen who works at the store.
He asked if he could help me.
Without thinking, I looked at him and said, I think I like playing with men's balls.
Nuts about You.
My sister and I were at the mall and passed by a store that sold a variety of nuts.
As we were looking at the display case, the boy behind the counter asked if we needed any help.
I replied, No, I'm just looking at your nuts.
My sister started to laugh hysterically, the boy grinned, and I turned beet-red and walked away.
To this day, my sister has never let me forget.
Na-na na-na na-nah!
While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release some pent-up energy and ran amok.
I was finally able to grab hold of her after receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other patrons.
I told her that if she did not start behaving right now she would be punished.
To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a voice just as threatening, If you don't let me go right now, I will tell Grandma that I saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!
The silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange.
Even the tellers stopped what they were doing.
I mustered up the last of my dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow.
The last thing I heard when the door closed behind me were screams of laughter.
It was the day before my eighteenth birthday.
I was living at home, but my parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited my girlfriend over for a romantic night alone.
As we lay in bed after making love, we heard the telephone ring downstairs.
I suggested to my girlfriend that I give her a nude piggyback ride to the phone.
Since we didn't want to miss the call, we didn't have time to get dressed.
My entire family: aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins and all my friends were standing there.
My girlfriend and I were frozen in a state of shock and embarrassment for what seemed like an eternity.
Since then, no one in my family has planned a surprise party again.
Priceless.
One of the funniest most-embarrassing-moment stories I've come upon in a long time was about a lady who picked up several items at a discount store.
When she finally got up to the checker, she learned that one of her items had no price tag.
In a business-like tone, a voice boomed back over the intercom.
Mom's Advice.
A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the class was squirming around, scratching his crotch and not paying attention.
The teacher told him to go down to the principal's office.
He was to phone his mother and ask her what he should do about it.
He did it and returned to his class.
Suddenly, there was a commotion at the back of the room.
She went back to investigate only to find him sitting at his desk with his penis hanging out.
I thought I told you to call your mom, she screamed.
I did, he said, And she told me that if I could stick it out till noon, she'd come and pick me up from school.
An escape convict, imprisoned for 1st degree murder, had spend 25-years of his sentence in prison.
While on the run, he broke into a house and tied up a young couple who had been sleeping in the bedroom.
He tied the man to a chair on one side of the room.
He got on the bed right over the woman, and it appeared he was kissing her neck.
Suddenly he got up and left the room.
I saw him kissing on your neck and then he left in a hurry.
Just cooperate and do anything he wants.
If he wants to have sex with you, just go along with it and pretend you like it.
Our lives depend on it!
You are right, he hasn't seen a woman in years, but he wasn't kissing my neck.
He was whispering in my ear.
He said that he thinks you are really cute and ask if we keep the Vaseline in the bedroom.
I'm making a black man cake cause I'm hungry as hell.
And the sweet tooth I have, only a brother can break the spell.
Let me reach into my spice rack to see what I can get.
To make a mix that will stick to my stomach you can bet.
Cause he's got to be sweet, mental, sound and deep.
Cinnamon is always good to accent the taste.
A few cups of culture So he's down for his race.
You see I won't bite into anything That's not conscious of its own.
That's why I stick to chocolate And leave the angel food alone.
I am adding butter cause he must be smooth.
I must add nuts so he can reproduce.
Can't leave him hanging cause I like kids too!
I think I'll add a little salt to balance him out.
And a dominant profile to show him some clout.
For a responsible man I'll throw in some yeast So he can rise to the occasion when I'm ready to feast.
I'll add 8 cups of strength and into the oven to bake.
Turn it up to 360 degrees to balance out his mental state.
Now that it's done, I'm sorry ladies I won't share the wealth That's why I'm sharing the recipe because I'm eating this black man all by myself.
Alcohol was an acquired taste.
Because of the warmth of the day I had had several drinks before casting my ballot, and divers drinks after casting it.
She uttered an exclamation of surprise.
For, be it known, in my younger days, despite my ardent democracy, I had been opposed to woman suffrage.
In my later and more tolerant years I had been unenthusiastic in my acceptance of it as an inevitable social phenomenon.
I answered.
I answered at length.
I answered indignantly.
The more I answered, the more indignant I became.
I was lighted up, I was feeling "good," I was pleasantly jingled.
"When the women get the ballot, they will vote for prohibition," I said.
I never am.
I am never less his friend than when he is with me and when I seem most his friend.
He is the king of liars.
He is the frankest truthsayer.
He is the august companion with whom one walks with the gods.
He is also in league with the Noseless One.
His way leads to truth naked, and to death.
He gives clear vision, and muddy dreams.
He is a red-handed killer, and he slays youth.
And Charmian looked at me, and I knew she wondered where I had got it.
I continued to talk.
As I say, I was lighted up.
In my brain every thought was at home.
Every thought, in its little cell, crouched ready-dressed at the door, like prisoners at midnight a jail-break.
I liked saloons.
Especially I liked the San Francisco saloons.
And once, I remember, a barkeeper mixed me a sweet temperance drink of syrup and sodawater.
My father did not pay for it.
I dreamed daydreams of him for years.
The saloon was south of Market Street in San Francisco.
It stood on the west side of the street.
As you entered, the bar was on the left.
On the right, against the wall, was the free lunch counter.
It was a long, narrow room, and at the rear, beyond the beer kegs on tap, were small, round tables and chairs.
The barkeeper was blue-eyed, and had fair, silky hair peeping out from under a black silk skullcap.
He and my father talked long, and I sipped my sweet drink and worshipped him.
And for years afterward I worshipped the memory of him.
Here was a child, forming its first judgments of the world, finding the saloon a delightful and desirable place.
Yes, the saloon was a mighty fine place, and it was more than that.
By the time I was ten years old, my family had abandoned ranching and gone to live in the city.
And here, at ten, I began on the streets as a newsboy.
One of the reasons for this was that we needed the money.
Another reason was that I needed the exercise.
I had found my way to the free public library, and was reading myself into nervous prostration.
On the poor ranches on which I had lived there had been no books.
In ways truly miraculous, I had been lent four books, marvellous books, and them I had devoured.
I was not a forward child.
Unlike Oliver Twist, I was incapable of asking for more.
When I returned the "Alhambra" to the teacher I hoped she would lend me another book.
I waited and yearned for her to lend me another book.
Here were thousands of books as good as my four wonder-books, and some were even better.
Libraries were not concerned with children in those days, and I had strange adventures.
I read everything, but principally history and adventure, and all the old travels and voyages.
I read mornings, afternoons, and nights.
You make me nervous.
And so, at ten, I was out on the streets, a newsboy.
I had no time to read.
I was busy getting exercise and learning how to fight, busy learning forwardness, and brass and bluff.
I had an imagination and a curiosity about all things that made me plastic.
Not least among the things I was curious about was the saloon.
And I was in and out of many a one.
In the saloons life was different.
Men talked with great voices, laughed great laughs, and there was an atmosphere of greatness.
Here was something more than common every-day where nothing happened.
There were no big moments when I trudged along the street throwing my papers in at doors.
And more, the saloons were right.
The city fathers sanctioned them and licensed them.
They were not the terrible places I heard boys deem them who lacked my opportunities to know.
Besides, in saloons I saw reporters, editors, lawyers, judges, whose names and faces I knew.
They put the seal of social approval on the saloon.
They verified my own feeling of fascination in the saloon.
They, too, must have found there that something different, that something beyond, which I sensed and groped after.
What it was, I did not know; yet there it must be, for there men focused like buzzing flies about a honey pot.
Not that I drank at that time.
From ten to fifteen I rarely tasted liquor, but I was intimately in contact with drinkers and drinking places.
Big jovial Josie Harper ran a road house at Telegraph Avenue and Thirty-ninth Street.
Here for a year I delivered an evening paper, until my route was changed to the water-front and tenderloin of Oakland.
I was ashamed to refuse, so I drank it.
The others asked for beer.
The boys snickered, and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange, searching scrutiny.
Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of ginger ale.
Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games, the boys enlightened me.
I had offended the barkeeper.
Besides, beer was food.
I could work better on it.
There was no food in ginger ale.
I was always aware that I was missing something.
What I really liked in those days was candy.
For five cents I could buy five "cannon-balls" - big lumps of the most delicious lastingness.
I could chew and worry a single one for an hour.
Then there was a Mexican who sold big slabs of brown chewing taffy for five cents each.
It required a quarter of a day properly to absorb one of them.
And many a day I made my entire lunch off one of those slabs.
In truth, I found food there, but not in beer.
I wanted to go to sea.
I wanted to get away from monotony and the commonplace.
Little I guessed how all the warp and woof of that manworld was entangled with alcohol.
So, one day, as I hoisted sail on my skiff, I met Scotty.
He was a husky youngster of seventeen, a runaway apprentice, he told me, from an English ship in Australia.
He had just worked his way on another ship to San Francisco; and now he wanted to see about getting a berth on a whaler.
Across the estuary, near where the whalers lay, was lying the sloop-yacht Idler.
The caretaker was a harpooner who intended sailing next voyage on the whale ship Bonanza.
Would I take him, Scotty, over in my skiff to call upon the harpooner?
And the harpooner who was caretaker!
How often had I seen him and envied him his freedom.
He never had to leave the water.
He slept aboard the Idler each night, while I had to go home upon the land to go to bed.
Would I take Scotty, the runaway sailor, to visit the harpooner, on the opiumsmuggler Idler?
The harpooner came on deck to answer our hail, and invited us aboard.
We went below.
It was the first sea-interior I had ever seen.
The clothing on the wall smelled musty.
But what of that?
Was it not the sea-gear of men?
And everywhere was in evidence the economy of space - the narrow bunks, the swinging tables, the incredible lockers.
At last I was living.
The harpooner suggested the eminent desirableness of a drink, and Scotty searched his pockets for dimes and nickels.
We drank the cheap rotgut out of tumblers.
Was I any the less strong, any the less valiant, than the harpooner and the sailor?
They were men.
They proved it by the way they drank.
Drink was the badge of manhood.
Divers times we filled the flask that afternoon.
I was only fourteen, and had never been on the ocean in my life.
We unbent.
Our inhibitions and taciturnities vanished.
The harpooner told of misadventures and secret shames.
And Scotty proved it.
Nor was I loath.
I could whip any runaway sailor seventeen years old.
By this time the singing stage was reached, and I joined Scotty and the harpooner in snatches of sea songs and chanties.
I was beginning to grasp the meaning of life.
We were not ordinary.
We were three tipsy young gods, incredibly wise, gloriously genial, and without limit to our powers.
But this is not a world of free freights.
Intenseness and duration are as ancient enemies as fire and water.
They are mutually destructive.
They cannot co-exist.
And John Barleycorn, mighty necromancer though he be, is as much a slave to organic chemistry as we mortals are.
We pay for every nerve marathon we run, nor can John Barleycorn intercede and fend off the just payment.
Yet the foregoing is all in after wisdom spoken.
His talk grew incoherent.
He groped for words and could not find them, while the ones he found his lips were unable to form.
His poisoned consciousness was leaving him.
The brightness went out of his eyes, and he looked as stupid as were his efforts to talk.
His face and body sagged as his consciousness sagged.
All his correlations were breaking down.
He strove to take another drink, and feebly dropped the tumbler on the floor.
Then, to my amazement, weeping bitterly, he rolled into a bunk on his back and immediately snored off to sleep.
Then the harpooner faded away into his bunk, and I was left alone, unthrown, on the field of battle.
I was very proud, and John Barleycorn was proud with me.
I could carry my drink.
I had drunk two men, drink for drink, into unconsciousness.
And I was still on my two feet, upright, making my way on deck to get air into my scorching lungs.
The fortunate man is the one who cannot take more than a couple of drinks without becoming intoxicated.
There were plenty of bunks below.
I did not need to go home.
But I wanted to demonstrate to myself how much I was a man.
There lay my skiff astern.
The last of a strong ebb was running out in channel in the teeth of an ocean breeze of forty miles an hour.
I set sail, cast off, took my place at the tiller, the sheet in my hand, and headed across channel.
The skiff heeled over and plunged into it madly.
The spray began to fly.
I was at the pinnacle of exaltation.
I sang "Blow the Man Down" as I sailed.
I was no boy of fourteen, living the mediocre ways of the sleepy town called Oakland.
I was a man, a god, and the very elements rendered me allegiance as I bitted them to my will.
The tide was out.
A full hundred yards of soft mud intervened between the boat-wharf and the water.
It was then that my correlations began to break down.
I lost my balance and pitched head-foremost into the ooze.
But what of it?
Across the channel two strong sailormen lay unconscious in their bunks where I had drunk them.
I was still on my legs, if they were knee-deep in mud.
I disdained to get back into the skiff.
I waded through the mud, shoving the skiff before me and yammering the chant of my manhood to the world.
I paid for it.
I was sick for a couple of days, meanly sick, and my arms were painfully poisoned from the barnacle scratches.
For a week I could not use them, and it was a torture to put on and take off my clothes.
The price was too stiff.
I had no moral qualms.
My revulsion was purely physical.
No exalted moments were worth such hours of misery and wretchedness.
When I got back to my skiff, I shunned the Idler.
I would cross the opposite side of the channel to go around her.
The harpooner was still about, but him I avoided.
Once, when he landed on the boat-wharf, I hid in a shed so as to escape seeing him.
I was afraid he would propose some more drinking, maybe have a flask full of whisky in his pocket.
It was memorable.
My mind dwelt on it continually.
I went over the details, over and over again.
The harpooner had told me terribly wonderful things of himself.
I had got behind my own soul and found unguessed potencies and greatnesses.
Yes, that day stood out above all my other days.
To this day it so stands out.
The memory of it is branded in my brain.
But the price exacted was too high.
I refused to play and pay, and returned to my cannon-balls and taffy-slabs.
The point is that all the chemistry of my healthy, normal body drove me away from alcohol.
It was abominable.
And detest and hate him all the time.
Month in and month out, the shortest day I ever worked was ten hours.
There was no time to wipe the bar, nor wash glasses, nor do anything save fill glasses.
The Oakland water-front can be real thirsty on occasion.
This method of jamming and struggling in front of the bar was too slow for us.
The drink was ours.
It was not a clear vision, however, and there were two phases of it, somewhat jumbled at the time.
Everywhere I saw men doing, drunk, what they would never dream of doing sober.
It was the penalty that must be paid.
Crime was destructive.
And then the police gathered them in and they vanished from our ken.
When they took sick, even with trifling afflictions that any ordinary man could pull through, they just pegged out.
So I considered my situation and knew that I was getting into a bad way of living.
It made toward death too quickly to suit my youth and vitality.
And there was only one way out of this hazardous manner of living, and that was to get out.
I met the seal-hunter, Pete Holt, and agreed to be his boat-puller and to sign on any schooner he signed on.
And I had to have half a dozen drinks with Pete Holt there and then to seal our agreement.
And at once awoke all my old unrest that John Barleycorn had put to sleep.
I lived more circumspectly, drank less deeply, and went home more frequently.
When drinking grew too wild, I got out.
When Nelson was in his maniacal cups, I managed to get separated from him.
Yet never did he refuse me any sum I asked of him.
Unfortunately, before I became prosperous, he moved away to another city.
And to this day I regret that he is gone.
It is the code I have learned.
This is not to exalt saloon-keepers.
But to return to the run of my narrative.
Nobody about me drank.
If any had drunk, and had they offered it to me, I surely would have drunk.
Also, I had found my way into the realm of the mind, and I was intellectually intoxicated.
I grew impatient.
Bud turned on his high boot-heels.
She looked at her husband with surprise in her steady gray eyes.
Barber has handled every head of stock from this ranch in that market for five years.
She faced Bud Turner.
"Deliver those cattle to Barber," she concluded positively.
Bud gazed impartially at the water-jar hanging on the gallery, stood on his other leg, and chewed a mesquite-leaf.
"Nonsense," said Santa impatiently.
Let me tell you.
I was a man before I married a cattle-queen.
What am I now?
The laughing-stock of the camps.
Santa looked at him closely.
Do I ever interfere in your management of the cattle?
I know the business side of the ranch much better than you do.
I learned it from Dad.
Be sensible.
I punch the cattle and you wear the crown.
These he began to tie deliberately upon his saddle.
Santa, a little pale, followed him.
Webb swung up into the saddle.
His serious, smooth face was without expression except for a stubborn light that smouldered in his eyes.
Lobos have killed three of the calves.
I forgot to leave orders.
"I am going to be a man again," he answered.
It is dark in there.
He will wear my red skirt and blue waist and brown mantilla.
I send you a hundred kisses.
Come surely and shoot quickly and straight.
Even the lady passenger was moved to expression.
"I think it is quite charming," she said, in her slow, crystal tones.
At intervals some one of the passengers would rise and humorously explore the room.
There was little evidence to be collected of its habitation by old man Redruth.
He never allowed nobody to come nigh him.
There was spinning-wheels up in his loft, all right.
Just ordinary trouble.
I never heard of no romance.
She never married him.
This man said she was the kind of girl you like to have reach across you in a car to pay the fare.
Although she was a staked claim, Miss Alice and the new entry seemed to strike a mutual kind of a clip.
Then he lifts his hat and walks away, and that was the last anybody in that town seen of him, as far as this man knew.
A little silence followed, except for the wind and the crackling of the fire.
Nameless to us, he travels the road from Paradise to Sunrise City.
He began with a rasping chuckle that gradually formed itself into words.
My money on the lad with the butterfly tie and the certified checks in his trouserings.
All right.
Away with him!
Get platonic, if you please.
No jack-pots for mine.
Go and hate your friend some more.
What turned him into a hermit?
One says laziness; one says remorse; one says booze.
I say women did it.
How old is the old man now?
He conducted his hermit shop here for twenty years.
Say he was twenty-five when he took off his hat at the gate.
That leaves twenty years for him to account for, or else be docked.
Where did he spend that ten and two fives?
Up for bigamy.
Redruth gets his cases mixed, and they send him up the road.
Enclosed find stamps.
If she be worthy of the name, no gold or rank will outweigh with her a genuine devotion.
Yet, who is on trial?
Not Redruth, for he has been punished.
Not those immortal passions that clothe our lives with the joy of the angels.
Each man of us here to-night stands at the bar to answer if chivalry or darkness inhabits his bosom.
To judge us sits womankind in the form of one of its fairest flowers.
I have not found woman to be so unspiritual or venal.
Tormented by jealousy, young Redruth vanished from his native haunts.
But had he just cause to do so?
There is no evidence for or against.
Then his withdrawal from the world of sorrow and the subsequent derangement of his faculties becomes intelligible.
She is old now.
Her hair is white and smoothly banded.
Each day she sits at the door and gazes longingly down the dusty road.
Presently, from the other, as Kinney and I sat without, there burst a volume of sudden and brilliant music.
A piano, and one so well played, seemed to me to be an unusual thing to find in that small and unpromising ranchhouse.
"A wise and generous theory," I assented.
Kinney plays well.
I am not learned in the science of music, but I should call her an uncommonly good performer.
She has technic and more than ordinary power.
"I did," said I.
I could see by the broken corrals that no one lived there.
And she was the most elegant kind of a housekeeper.
He had a pretty bad cold and cough.
I stayed to supper.
I like a man who is kind to animals.
Yes; there was even admiration in her gaze now.
After all, there was a hero rising out of the ruins of the anti-climax.
She held out her hand penitently.
There was a bright, unshed drop in each of her eyes.
Givens took the proffered hand.
Dry Valley had had no youth.
Even his childhood had been one of dignity and seriousness.
His life as a young man had been wasted.
But a sheepman is a hardy animal.
Dry Valley Johnson had weathered too many northers to turn his back on a late summer, spiritual or real.
He would show them.
Dry Valley kept indoors closely for a week except for frequent sallies after youthful strawberry snatchers.
Then, a few days later, he suddenly emerged brilliantly radiant in the hectic glow of his belated midsummer madness.
A jay-bird-blue tennis suit covered him outwardly, almost as far as his wrists and ankles.
A little flat straw hat with a striped band desecrated his weather-beaten head.
Lemon-coloured kid gloves protected his oak-tough hands from the benignant May sunshine.
It lasted two weeks and then came to a sudden end.
"Merry Christmas, little boy," said Cherokee.
What do I want with dolls and tin horses?
I want to go home.
Trinidad stepped into the breach.
But me and the Judge was sure we could round up a wagonful of candidates for your gimcracks.
We can dump the stuff down a shaft or throw it away.
Bobby had retreated to a distant chair, and was coldly regarding the scene with ennui plastered thick upon him.
Cherokee, lingering with his original idea, went over and sat beside him.
"Granite Junction," said Bobby without emphasis.
The room was warm.
Cherokee took off his cap, and then removed his beard and wig.
The boy hesitated.
"On the bureau at home," he answered.
The picture belongs to my mother.
She puts it under her pillow of nights.
And once I saw her kiss it.
But women are that way.
Cherokee rose and beckoned to Trinidad.
"Keep this boy by you till I come back," he said.
I wish I was at home.
Bobby slipped a cigarette from his pocket and was trying to snap a match.
"Throw that cigarette away," said Cherokee, in a quiet but new voice.
Bobby hesitated, and then dropped the cylinder overboard.
"Throw the box, too," commanded the new voice.
More reluctantly the boy obeyed.
I seen her do it.
Will you get me one?
Cherokee took out his watch.
Are you cold?
Sit closer, son.
Down in the hotel office three or four of the labourers were growling and swearing over a belated game of checkers.
Heavy odours of stewed meat, hot grease, and cheap coffee hung like a depressing fog about the house.
Lena lit the stump of a candle and sat limply upon her wooden chair.
She was eleven years old, thin and ill-nourished.
Her back and limbs were sore and aching.
But the ache in her heart made the biggest trouble.
The last straw had been added to the burden upon her small shoulders.
Fritz urged them along, himself dizzy and muddled over his fearful adventure.
According to schedule time, he should have reached Fredericksburg at daylight.
He stopped his team at the gate and called.
Her little Lena drown herself!
Why had they sent her from home?
What could be done?
Perhaps it would be too late by the time they could send for her now.
Peter Hildesmuller dropped his meerschaum on the walk and it shivered into pieces.
It is your fault if she comes home to us no more.
Fritz stared at her with eyes that bulged behind his spectacles.
What an opportunity it would offer to Calliope!
He had only to step out the other door, mount the train, and away.
The members of the posse heard one shot fired inside, and then there was silence.
At length the wounded man opened his eyes.
After a blank space he again could see and hear and feel and think.
Turning his eyes about, he found himself lying on a wooden bench.
A tall man with a perplexed countenance, wearing a big badge with "City Marshal" engraved upon it, stood over him.
He was trying to get these facts fixed in his mind and connected with past events, when the old woman began to talk.
That bullet never tetched ye!
Jest skeeted along the side of your head and sort of paralysed ye for a spell.
You just lay still a while longer and let me bathe your head.
I come in on that train from Alabama to see my son.
This is my son, sir.
Jest think, now, that little boy of mine has got to be a officer - a city marshal of a whole town!
But, laws!
I never was much of a hand to git skeered.
I knowed him at oncet.
He sat, somewhat weakly yet, leaning against the wall.
He was a rugged man, big-boned and straight.
His eyes, steady and keen, seemed to linger upon the face of the man standing so still above him.
Be a good man, and leave liquor alone and live peaceably and goodly.
Keep away from bad company and work honest and sleep sweet.
The black-mitted hand of the old pleader gently touched the breast of the man she addressed.
Very earnest and candid her old, worn face looked.
Still the man to whom she spoke gazed above her head, contemplating the silent son of the old mother.
The tall man moved uneasily.
He fingered the badge on his breast for a moment, and then he put an arm around the old woman and drew her close to him.
The other man rose to his feet, trying his limbs and stretching his muscles.
The unblessed condition of Yellowhammer had been truly described.
Later they would come.
But of children there were none.
Christmas would come on Thursday.
On Tuesday morning Trinidad, instead of going to work, sought the Judge at the Lucky Strike Hotel.
You might say that that man made this town.
I am indebted to Cherokee for past favours.
I learned about that Latin word at school.
"I will accompany you," declared the Judge, waving his cane.
Trinidad made careful notes of all such, and then hastened to secure a vehicle and team.
He sat in the snow, arms tied behind him, waiting the torture.
He stared curiously before him at a huge Cossack, prone in the snow, moaning in his pain.
The men had finished handling the giant and turned him over to the women.
Subienkow looked on, and shuddered.
He was not afraid to die.
He had carried his life too long in his hands, on that weary trail from Warsaw to Nulato, to shudder at mere dying.
But he objected to the torture.
It offended his soul.
This would not be nice.
To pass out bravely and cleanly, with a smile and a jest - ah!
There had been no chance to escape.
He sighed.
"A husband," said Santa cordially.
"Come on and have a beer," I invited.
"I wish you success in a praiseworthy attempt," she said, with a sudden coldness.
"S-s-sh," says I.
"Small beer for me, Johnny," I said, when the others had ordered schooners.
"Sure," Johnny agreed, with a smile.
After a couple more drinks, for which I insisted on paying, Nelson decided to go.
Again we stood at the bar and drank and talked, but this time it was I who paid ten cents!
All you got to do is walk right up and call for it.
Almost it seemed the final badge of manhood.
Amongst strong men I had proved myself strong.
And sitting there on the stringer-piece in my shame, I did a great deal of thinking and transvaluing of values.
And the heat of my shame burned up my neck and into my cheeks and forehead.
And then it had been only one little undershirt.
And up runs the boy with the flaxseed.
And we had another, and I paid for it.
And when I never drew a sober breath, on one stretch, for three solid weeks, I was certain I had reached the top.
And when he reached the horizon he might have ridden on into blue space as far as knowledge of him on the Nopalito went.
At Haywards there were no drinks either.
At once I became possessed with a desire to have a page in that book.
Aye, even the barkeeper was giving me a recommendation as a man.
Be Strong and I Love You.
Be Strong and I Love you.
Besides, I was learning.
Then an idea came to me.
Very well.
